## 📈 **Analysis Workflow**

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load dataset and validate structure.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Remove non-numeric symbols like `$`, `%`, and `,`. Convert columns to numeric.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Compute summary stats and visualize:  
   - ROI and Conversion trends  
   - Performance by Campaign Type  
   - ROI by Target Audience  
   - Channel effectiveness  

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Conduct ANOVA & t-tests to test ROI differences  
   - Explore correlations among numeric features  

5. **Visualization Dashboard**  
   - Campaign ROI distribution  
   - Conversion Rate by Channel  
   - Engagement vs Impressions  
   - Correlation heatmap  

6. **Insight Generation**  
   - Identify top-performing campaigns  
   - Recommend optimal marketing strategies
